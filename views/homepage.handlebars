<ol class="post-list">
  {{#each posts as |post|}}
  <li>
    {{> post-info post }}
  </li>
  {{/each}}
</ol>

{{!-- Note the use of {{#each}} to begin the loop and {{/each}} to define where it ends.
Any HTML code in between (e.g., the <li> element) will be repeated for every item in posts. --}}

  {{!-- To use a partial, all we need is the > character, 
  followed by the name of the partial file and the object we'll pass to the partial. --}}
