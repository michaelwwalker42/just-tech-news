{{!-- In Handlebars.js, we can use the trusty keyword -this- to refer to 
the parent object or array that's available in the context of the partial. 
Data that's passed to a template file is technically always part of this, 
but when dealing with objects, we can simply access the object properties directly 
(e.g., vote_count instead of this.vote_count).
 Because arrays don't have named properties like objects do, 
 we're forced to access the array as -this.-   --}}

 {{!-- Because this is being looped over, all of the expressions within the loop look 
 for properties on each object in this. In this case, that means each comment. --}}
